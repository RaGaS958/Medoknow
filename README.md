  Add Indian regional languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.) for better reach and inclusivity.

- 📡 **API Integration**  
  Connect with real-time medical databases (like DrugBank, OpenFDA) for updated drug info and interactions.

  Make the app installable with offline capabilities for areas with limited internet access.
